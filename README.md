# HTWK Robots Shared Autonomy Challenge for RoboCup SPL 2024 World Championship

In this publication you will find the code for the Shared Autonomy Challenge (SAC) by team [HTWK Robots](https://htwk.bot/).

The SAC Code is divided into 2 Parts: the GUI running on the operators laptop and TODO.

## Part 1: GUI

The GUI can be found in `Python-GUI`. It was tested to run under Linux and Windows and requires Python 3 to run. The Python dependencies are defined in `requirements.txt` and can be installed with `pip`.

The program can be run on Linux via `src/main.sh` or using the IDE PyCharm. The GUI connects to a Nao robot running TODO. The IP address of the robot can be adjusted in `src/main.py`.

## Part 2: TODO
